# Katrina-App Personal Dashboard Application

## Get start
Run the project locally, please use `npm start`
Note: I have deployed the app to AWS Amplify, but due to the limitation of NewsAPI, the news list cannot be shown (it can work in local).Other functionalities can work after deployment. 
Deployment app: https://main.d1die97jpj8r3u.amplifyapp.com/

## Project instruction
The application's frontend is developed using React TypeScript, complemented by the MUI UI library for a seamless and interactive user interface. On the backend, AWS Amplify and GraphQL are employed to manage server-side operations efficiently. Task-related data is securely stored in DynamoDB, ensuring high availability and consistent performance.

## Screen recording
This is the live demo for the app.
